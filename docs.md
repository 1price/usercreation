# UserCreation Docs:
- Script errors
- Linkvertise errors

# Script Errors
The following list contains common errors and the responding fixes.

## Things you need to know:
- Always remember to inject your executor ON your roblox home page.
- All keys are HWID linked. This means that you can not use the same key on a different HWID.
- Almost all executors are supported - including solara.

## Global fix:
**Most errors can be fixed by these 4 simple steps:**
1. Open the "run" console by doing command + R on your keyboard, it should look something like this:

2. In the "run" console, type "%temp% and then press enter.

3. It should open your computers temp folder. In this folder, delete **EVERYTHING EXEPT** the "roblox" folder.

4. Re-install your executor, whether this is Solara or any other executor - it does not matter.

**After completing these steps - UserCreation should run smoothly.**

## Connection timed our error:
This error occurs when your key is not being registered. This can be caused by many things - making it hard to have a specific fix.

- Try out the [global fix](https://github.com/1price/usercreation/main/docs.md##global-fix) - this will probably be your best option.
- Try using a VPN - this can suprisingly work sometimes.

## Invalid key - but your key is correct:

This could be happening for multiple reasons:
- Your key has been used on another computer - making it invalid for you or anyone else who tries to use it.
- Wait a couple minutes, the API may just need some time to update.
- Your IP could be blacklisted or rate limited - try again in a couple minutes.
- Your key has expired.

## Blank GUI:

- Try out the [global fix](https://github.com/1price/usercreation/main/docs.md##global-fix) - this will probably be your best option.
- Re-execute the script.
- Rejoin the game.

# Linkvertise Errors
The following list contains common errors regarding the free key system and linkvertise.

## 1 hour/45 minute wait time:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2772b41-d9aa-46e1-a47d-3537826c8fdd)

- The occurs when you have used linkvertise more than twice in the last 12 hours.
- If you try to use a bypasser like "bypass.city" you will be detected and be given longer wait times by linkvertise.
- VPN usage. Very rarely linkvertise will give longer wait times to users who have an active VPN running.

## You have been blacklisted:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f28509-9584-4dd9-a670-2c52d7befcdc)

- This means that keyguardian has temporarily blocked your IP due to rate-limiting. You will need to wait a couple minutes before access is re-allowed.
